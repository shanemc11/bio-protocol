Quantitative analysis of actin cable length in yeast

This protocol is used to quantify actin cable lengths and architecture (see: "Scaling of subcellular actin structures with cell length through decelerated growth", doi:10.7554/eLife.68424), and is published in Bio-protocol (doi: ####). Here you will find ImageJ/FIJI macros and Python scripts used for image processing and data analysis. Previous datasets generated from this protocol can be accessed at Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.4791679).
